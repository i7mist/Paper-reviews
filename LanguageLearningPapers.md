An array of papers related to language learning
===============================================

* [Computers and language learning: an overview, 1998](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aa93/9897656839e593d8c456607a646f89808a13.pdf)
  - In this paper, it summarizes several thrusts of work that tries to build software to help with language learning:
    - provide realistic, native-speaker models of the language in a variety of media
    - offer a language learning curriculum
    - do a needs assessment
    - determine the best next step for the learner and provide practice with that skill area
    - record what the student has done, along with an evaluation
    - be available at any hour and require no additional pay or benefits.
  - This list has basically covered almost every approach that I can think of for a language learning software
  - Is there any of them still have room to improve by leveraging the most cutting-edge technologies?
  - Can we think of other new form of computing techniques other than software? AR, VR, chatbot, fabrication, wearable devices, etc.?
  - It also discusses the benefits of adding a computer component to language instruction
    - multimodal practice with feedback
    - individualisation in a large class
    - pair and small group work on projects, either collaboratively or competitively
    - the fun factor
    - variety in the resources available and learning styles used
    - exploratory learning with large amounts of language data
    - real-life skill-building in computer use.
  - Unfortunately (or fortunately?), this list made in 1998 has also covered most of the topics that we are still discussing today.
  - I have thought of some changes since 1998 that are relatively radical:
    - The information explosion: You can nearly find anything online, while the type and amount of 1998 is much more limited. (I have a very visceral feeling about this.)
    - ubiquitous computing: The prevalence of smartphone makes people stay online all the time, which potentially support a large pool for crowdsourcing applications that can achieve nearly real-time responses
