A list of papers that examined programming with the lens of cognitive science

### How do we approach this problem?
* [ON THE COGNITIVE PREREQUISITES OF LEARNING COMPUTER PROGRAMMING](https://web.stanford.edu/~roypea/RoyPDF%20folder/A17_Pea_Kurland_83.pdf)
  - Study on the cognitive perspective of programming started back in 1950s. However, after three decades, the studies still focused on what aptitute variables correlate with programming skills. This paper tried to approach this problem from a more fundamental perspective.
  - What factors may affect the programming performance is highly-dependent on the goal of programming. For example, if a program is not user-facing, then documenting it and the corresponding mental skills required are not necessary.
  - There were roughly four levels of expertise of programming, and they are listed below in the ascending order with respect to expertise: program user, code generator, program generator, software developer. The major difference between program generators and software developers is that software developers can develop a program that is intended to be used by other people. Software developers can not only build sophisticated logic, but are also good at documenting, debugging, writing tests for the program, doing optimization, simulating how the program runs in the brain, designing the app before implementing it, and they usually draw on libraries and programming utilities to reduce development time.
