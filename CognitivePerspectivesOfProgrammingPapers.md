A list of papers that examined programming with the lens of cognitive science

### How do we approach this problem?
* [ON THE COGNITIVE PREREQUISITES OF LEARNING COMPUTER PROGRAMMING](https://web.stanford.edu/~roypea/RoyPDF%20folder/A17_Pea_Kurland_83.pdf)
  - Study on the cognitive perspective of programming started back in 1950s. However, after three decades, the studies still focused on what aptitute variables correlate with programming skills. This paper tried to approach this problem from a more fundamental perspective.
  - What factors may affect the programming performance is highly-dependent on the goal of programming. For example, if a program is not user-facing, then documenting it and the corresponding mental skills required are not necessary.
  - There were roughly four levels of expertise of programming, and they are listed below in the ascending order with respect to expertise: program user, code generator, program generator, software developer. The major difference between program generators and software developers is that software developers can develop a program that is intended to be used by other people. Software developers can not only build sophisticated logic, but are also good at documenting, debugging, writing tests for the program, doing optimization, simulating how the program runs in the brain, designing the app before implementing it, and they usually draw on libraries and programming utilities to reduce development time.
  - Characteristics of programming skills:
  - A difference in what the perceived structure of program is between novice and experienced programmers have been identified.
    - For novice developers, the most programs were constructed from a small set of basic program schemas comparable to the "plan library" of Schrobe et al.
    - For "experts", they saw whole blocks of code as "instantiations" of well-known problems such as calculating change.
  - A large number of component rules underlied an experts' generation of programming problem solutions
  - the ability to construct detailed mental models of how the computer is functioning when a computer program is running.
  - Experts have advantages in short-term memory for meaningful chunks of information compared to novices. The classific findings from the studies of chess players were repeatedly replicated for the domain of computer programming.
    - experts clustered keywords based on the meanings in a language (ALGOL), while novices clustered them based on surface ordinary language associations.
  - Expert developers debug their programs in different ways than novices. Program debugging involves comprehension processes analogous to those for reading ordnary language prose. Experts read programs for flow of control (execution), rather than line by line (as text).
  - Theories of cognitive subtasks in programming:
    -  They maybe summarized as: (1) understanding the programming problem; (2) designing or plan- ning a programming solution; (3) writing a programming code that implements the plan; and (4) comprehension of the written program and program debugging.
 - Understanding the problem: set up some form of problem representation in the working memory initially
 - Designing and planning: planning-in-action vs. preplanning; plans are highly hierarchical.

### Studying the cognitive process of programming using eye tracking

### Cognitive style and programming

### Expert and novice developers have different performance if programming tasks, because:
  - Different skills to comprehend the program behavior without running it.
    - (Debugging by skilled and novice programmers)[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=22367]

### The implications of the various choices of information sources
