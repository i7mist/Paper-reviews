This can be viewed together with [this one](https://github.com/i7mist/Paper-reviews/blob/master/EqualityOfOpportunityInSupervisedLearning_MoritzHardt_2016.md), and a lot of other papers that also tries to formalize the definition of fairness and other social norms so that they can beome and integral part of an algorithm.
