Programming and neural nets
---------------------------

* [Neural Code Comprehension: A Learnable Representation of Code Semantics](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7617-neural-code-comprehension-a-learnable-representation-of-code-semantics)

Interpretability
----------------

* [Model Agnostic Supervised Local Explanations](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7518-model-agnostic-supervised-local-explanations)
- common forms of interpretability systems: example-based, local and global explanations
- MAPLE
- address the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff
- provide more faithful local explanation than LIME
