Attitudes and Motivation: Their Role in Second-Language Acquisition
===================================================================

R.C.Gardner
-----------
* Parents' attitudes towards the linguistic group of the second language their children learn will affect their children's attitudes to that group as well and affect their performance in learning this language.
* Integrative motive: Showing an interest in acquiring that language for purposes of integrating with the community that speaks it. Another way to describe it is "a sincere and personal interest in the people and culture represented by the other language group"
* Instrumental motive: (in opposite of integrative motive) This motive pertains to the potential pragmatic gains of L2 proficiency, such as to get a better job or pass a required examination.
* Whether the children hold an integrative attitude or instrumental attitude to L2 is highly dependent on and consistent with their parents' attitudes towards that cultural group.
* L2 achievement is facilitated by an integrative motive, and the development of such motive is dependent upon a particular attitudinal atmosphere in the home. (That's 1968. How about in 2010s and for the millennials? Are they equaly influenced, if not more heavily, by the atmosphere on the Internet?)
* Instead of focusing on a specific language, the author suggested that we should focus on the usefulness of the language in the community where the learners live in. Whether it is a high-use language, which means it is a highly active language in that community, and the proficiency in this language allows one to communicate in a situation where otherwise he couldn't, or a low-use language, which means the individuals can function almost without this language in this community. Besides the binary view, the author also mentioned it's important to look at whether there are multiple high-use languages in the community, so that the target language is not the only avenue. For example, for the Navajo living in a border town, they could either use English solely, or limit most of the communications to their native language, and learn a very limited amount of English for highly specific purposes.
* Social factors affect students' motivations: "With the increased age and contact with the educational system, it might be hypothesized that the Indian children appear to be becoming more like the non-Indian community." At least to their teachers' feelings
