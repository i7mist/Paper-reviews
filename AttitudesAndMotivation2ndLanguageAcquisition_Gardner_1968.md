Attitudes and Motivation: Their Role in Second-Language Acquisition
===================================================================

R.C.Gardner
-----------
* Parents' attitudes towards the linguistic group of the second language their children learn will affect their children's attitudes to that group as well and affect their performance in learning this language.
* Integrative motive: Showing an interest in acquiring that language for purposes of integrating with the community that speaks it. Another way to describe it is "a sincere and personal interest in the people and culture represented by the other language group"
* Instrumental motive: (in opposite of integrative motive) This motive pertains to the potential pragmatic gains of L2 proficiency, such as to get a better job or pass a required examination.
